Jane Smith	5/5/2025 10:01:21 AM	5/5/2025 10:01:40 AM	Jane Smith	Yes, LinkedIn and Twitter were the top performers for the week.

Sarah Kim	5/5/2025 10:01:56 AM	5/5/2025 10:02:10 AM	Sarah Kim	Quick question — are we including regional breakdowns this time?

Michael Lee	5/5/2025 10:02:41 AM	5/5/2025 10:03:00 AM	Michael Lee	We resolved three of the five open issues. The final two are backend-related.
John Doe	5/5/2025 10:03:01 AM	5/5/2025 10:03:15 AM	John Doe	Any blockers we should escalate?
Michael Lee	5/5/2025 10:03:16 AM	5/5/2025 10:03:35 AM	Michael Lee	No, we just need some more time. They’re a bit complex but under control.
Sarah Kim	5/5/2025 10:03:36 AM	5/5/2025 10:03:50 AM	Sarah Kim	Are those related to the API latency from last week?
Michael Lee	5/5/2025 10:03:51 AM	5/5/2025 10:04:05 AM	Michael Lee	Exactly. We’re optimizing the data caching layer.
Jane Smith	5/5/2025 10:04:06 AM	5/5/2025 10:04:25 AM	Jane Smith	That should help with the response times our users flagged in feedback.
John Doe	5/5/2025 10:04:26 AM	5/5/2025 10:04:40 AM	John Doe	Thanks everyone. Let’s aim to close those out by Friday.
